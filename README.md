# DATA0006_assign_2
------------------------------------------------------
In this report, there are two datasets used for our modelling. The approach and algorithms are based on
Supervised Machine Learning (predictive modelling).
We used data mining techniques:
• Data cleaning preprocessing,
• Predictive modelling (Classification for categorical class label & Regression for numerical classlabel),
• Decision Tree,
• kFold,
• KNN,
• Chi square test,
• SelectKBest,
• PCA and
• Train/Test method.
The various stages of modelling included:
a) Data Collection and Extraction
b) Data Transformation
c) Data Analytics and Machine Learning Algorithms
The Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Scipy were used
